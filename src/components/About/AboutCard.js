            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Nguyen Hoang Hai </span>

            Third-year student majoring in Information Technology at Saigon
            University, with a solid foundation in programming and software
            development. Passionate about learning and eager to apply knowledge
            in practice, I have participated in and led several programming
            projects such as the CarMaster car dealership management
            application. With strong teamwork and communication skills, I am
            seeking an internship opportunity in a professional environment to
            further develop my skills and contribute to the success of the
            company.
